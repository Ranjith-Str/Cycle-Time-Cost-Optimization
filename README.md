# Cycle Time vs Cost Analysis  


## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
Analyze how manufacturing **cycle time** affects **unit cost** across materials and suppliers,  
and identify process areas for cost optimization.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning (Performed in Python)  
1. Loaded raw file `cycle_cost_raw_unclean.csv`.  
2. Removed duplicates and null records.  
3. Fixed negative `CostPerUnitINR` and invalid cycle times.  
4. Capped outliers using
